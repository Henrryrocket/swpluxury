          <div class="p-description description">
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is their ability to market your property to the right target audience.

                <p class = "text">Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote your property. Being able to create high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that elevates the agents who use luxury real estate marketing services above their competitors. According to a recent survey,<b><em> <a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/identifying-target-market-important-company-76792.html">85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work with an agent who uses video </a> </em></b> and for good reason. </p>

          <p class = "wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__slow">An agent who uses video is able to connect with potential buyers on a deeper level and build trust and rapport. When they use video to market your property, they are showing viewers what it would really be like to walk through and live in your home—something that is much more difficult to do with a written description.</p>

For your home to show up in these types of searches, your real estate agent needs to use the right terms in your online marketing. The effective use of these terms is referred to as search engine optimization or SEO. The process of identifying and correctly using the right terms is a bit of a science—one that the SEO experts at Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential buyer searches terms that match your home, your property will show up in the results and provide opportunities for the buyer to learn more.</p>
